[Licensing a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository) is an important step for every open source project. But the process of licensing seems to be rather official and too complicated for some small piece of code which currently is used only as an example. But take a look at [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/) and the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/). Besides the drawbacks of not using a license, you will find out that adding a license to your repository does not involve any official registrations or similar things. Instead, it is as easy as adding a new file called `LICENSE` based on some template to the root of your repository. Using GitHub the process can be even accelerated by using the standard templates already provided. The usual choice would be the so-called `MIT License`. I would suggest using this simple feature wherever possible.
